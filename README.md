# Financial Asset Analysis Lab

This project involves analyzing a set of financial assets through a series of calculations and visualizations. Key tasks include:

1. **Daily Percentage Returns**: Calculate daily returns for each asset.
2. **Correlation Matrix**: Compute the correlation matrix across all assets.
3. **Portfolio Analysis**:
   - Load asset weights from `portfolio_weights.csv`.
   - Generate an area plot of asset weights over time.
   - Calculate and visualize the portfolio's cumulative historical return.
   - Compute the portfolio's annualized return and volatility (using a 261-day annualization factor).

### Extras
- Grouped Area Plot: Display an area plot of weights by asset family, as specified in `financial_assets_information.csv`.
- Scatter Plot: Generate a scatter plot comparing the returns of two selected assets.
